This repository demonstrates how to write a local override an upstream module that is included in an upstream class.

I am using “theirs” and “ours” to demonstrate the concerns.  The “theirs” files
are from an upstream dependency.  The “ours” files are things that are part of
my application.

There are four primary files:

- main.rb :: The application boot logic.
- theirs/their_module.rb :: The module that they mixin to /their/ class.
- theirs/their_class.rb :: The class that /they/ provide.
- ours/their_module.rb :: The changes to /their/ module that we want to apply to /their/ class (by way of /their/ module) for /our/ application.

To see the output of the method changes run =$ ruby main.rb=.
